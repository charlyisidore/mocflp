Here you will find a collection of instances to test with the program. 
This collection is divided into two parts : F-instances and H-instances.

The format of the instance is the same and looks like this :

#BEGIN OF FILE
> m : nbr of customers
> n : nbr of facilities
>
> matrix of assignation [ m x n ] over the first objective
> matrix of assignation [ m x n ] over the second objective
>
> cost of opening a facility over the first objective
>
> cost of opening a facility over the second objective

> demands of customers
>
> capacities of facilities
#END OF FILE

Thanks to Professor Elena Fernandez (Universitat Polit√®cnica de 
Catalunya, Barcelona, ES) to provide us these set of instances. Please
visit her website to have more informations : 
http://www-eio.upc.es/~elena/sscplp/

This data is a collection of instances with m facilities and n
customers coming from the sus-mentionned website. In comparaison to 
the original set, we agregate the instance by pair to have a 
bi-objective problem. The symbolic of the name is : 
F[first_instance_m_n]-[second_instance_m_n].txt

e.g: F50-51.txt refers to an instance with m customers and n 
facilities and with data set coming from instances p50.txt and 
p51.txt of the website.
