Here you will find a collection of instances to test with the program. 
This collection is divided into two parts : F-instances and H-instances.

The format of the instance is the same and looks like this :

#BEGIN OF FILE
> n : nbr of customers
> m : nbr of facilities
>
> matrix of assignation [ m x n ] over the first objective
> matrix of assignation [ m x n ] over the second objective
>
> cost of opening a facility over the first objective
>
> cost of opening a facility over the second objective
#END OF FILE

We want to thank Professor Ch. Mumford (Carfiff University, UK) to 
provide this set of data set for these experiments.
Please visit her website to have more informations : 
http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/C.L.Mumford/Research%20Topics/FLP/papers/data/

This data is a collection of instances with 10 facilities and various 
number of customers. Due to a common parser, we deleted all the 
capacity values from the original set of instances. The symbolic of 
the name is : H[number_of_facilities]-[number_of_customers].txt

e.g: H10-2000.txt refers to an instance with 10 facilities 
and 2000 customers.

The instance H5-10.txt is a didactic instance with 5 facilities 
and 10 customers.

Thanks to Professor Elena Fernandez (Universitat Politècnica de 
Catalunya, Barcelona, ES) to provide us these set of instances. Please
visit her website to have more informations : 
http://www-eio.upc.es/~elena/sscplp/

This data is a collection of instances with 30 facilities and 90
customers coming from the sus-mentionned website. In comparaison to 
the original set, we agregate the instance by pair to have a 
bi-objective problem. The symbolic of the name is : 
F[first_instance_90_30]-[second_instance_90_30].txt

e.g: F50-51.txt refers to an instance with 90 customers and 30 
facilities and with data set coming from instances p50.txt and 
p51.txt of the website.
